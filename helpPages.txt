HELPPAGENAME:setShort
set usage: set [-e][-f][-h][-H][-u][-uA] (args)
ENDHELPPAGE

HELPPAGENAME:set
set usage: set [-e][-f][-h][-H][-u][-uA] (args)
View or set the value of an environment variable, or manipulate certain special environment variables.

Args must be in one of two forms:
1: '$[variableName]'
2: '$[variableName]=[variableValue]'

Calling set with a form 1 arg will simply print the value of the arg. If the arg doesn't exist, an error message will be printed.
Alternatively, if the -u commandline arg is set, this will unset the environment variable. If the arg doesn't exist, nothing will happen. 

Calling set with a form 2 arg will set the variableName to variableValue. From now on, referencing the variable name with a dollar sign will replace the variable name
with the variable value for any GAMMA function. Note: the -u environment variable will not interact with form 2 args. 

Any number of args may be called. Any args that don't start with $ will be ignored.

Command Line Args
-e: If -e is set for a batch mode session, if a process returns a non 0 exit value, batch mode will stop. (Batch mode does not halt by default)
-f: If -f is set, disable wildcard globbing. (Wildcards are default on)
-C: disable overwrite of files from > or 2>. Default allows overrides
-h: print short help message
-H: print full help message
-u: unset mode, calling any form 1 arg will unset it instead of printing the value.
-uA: unsets all environment variables.

Examples
'set': lists every environment variable
'set $arg1="Hello, World!"': sets $arg1 to 'Hello, World!'
'set $arg1="Hello, World!"' $arg2=teapot': sets $arg1 to 'Hello, World!' and $arg2 to 'teapot'
'set $arg1=1234': sets $arg1 to 1234 
'set -u $arg1': if $arg1 is set, unset it. 
'set -u $arg1 $arg2 $arg3 $arg4': attempt to unset $arg1, $arg2, $arg3, $arg4.
'set -uA': unsets all environment variables. 
'set -uA $arg1=teapot': sets $arg1 to 'teapot' AFTER clearing all environment variables
